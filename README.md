# Hello, I'm Joy!

## Open Source Journey

- Contributed to the `requests` library by working on adding type hints to improve code readability and maintainability. This experience enhanced my understanding of type hints in Python and the open-source contribution process.
- Contributed to the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) test framework by improving the documentation for the `exports` interface, clarifying its limitations in browser environments, and guiding users toward fully supported alternatives like BDD and TDD.
